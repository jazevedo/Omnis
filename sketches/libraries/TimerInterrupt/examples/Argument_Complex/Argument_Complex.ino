 *
 * Now we can use these new 16 ISR-based timers, while consuming only 1 hardware Timer.
 * Their independently-selected, maximum interval is practically unlimited (limited only by unsigned long miliseconds)
 * The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
 * Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
 * This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * Special design is necessary to share data between interrupt code and the rest of your program.
 * Variables usually need to be "volatile" types. Volatile tells the compiler to avoid optimizations that assume 
 * variable can not spontaneously change. Because your function may change variables while your program is using them, 
 * the compiler needs this hint. But volatile alone is often not enough.
 * When accessing shared variables, usually interrupts must be disabled. Even with volatile, 
 * if the interrupt changes a multi-byte variable between a sequence of instructions, it can be read incorrectly. 
 * If your data is multiple variables, such as an array and a count, usually interrupts need to be disabled 
 * or the entire sequence of your code which accesses the data.
